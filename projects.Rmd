## WGBS Profiling and DMR Detecting

- Applied exploratory data analysis to acquire a big-picture 
- Utilized HMM to analyze CpG islands and non-CpG islands and accessed sensitivity and specificity by CART. 
- Implemented efficient smoothing methods and the variogram model to disentangle spatial structures from noisy data. 
- Currently using the logistic regression to get a basic sense of DMR. 


## [A R Package RcppMovStat](https://peleonard.github.io/R_pkg.html)

- Built a R package using *Rcpp*, using its syntactic sugar, gluing C++ to R. 
- Efficiently calculated moving statistics, e.g. moving average, 5 ~ 6 times than similar package
- Designed a routine to obtain moving statistics for *unevenly* spaced data.
- Published it to [Github](https://github.com/peleonard/RcppMovStat.git) and **R-CRAN** and deployed a \textsc{shinyApp}.

## Overview of Supervised Learning

- Built a framework of generalized basis expansion quantitative prediction: subset selection, bias-variance trade-off, accessing statistical accuracy.
- Analyzed a dataset following above procedures.
- Obtained an optimal model based on the tabular errors and visualized uncertainty in Matlab.

## Classification Methods and ROC curves

- Preprocessed the heart disease data.
- Employed PCA to check underlying clustering feature.
- Performed discriminant analysis, random forests and supporting vector machines.  And concluded nonlinear boundaries by SVM with polynomial kernel.


## Reproduction of Rational Quadrature

- Determined a discretization procedure for the integral of some special type of rational functions.
- Programmed in Matlab to evaluate the exactness of this approximation.
